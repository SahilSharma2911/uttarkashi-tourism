            dramatic cross over trek and is one of the challenging options
            available for people who want to hit higher altitude. You get to
            witness everything on this trek starting from forests of mulling,
            grasslands of mulling, Kashmir like meadows of Karah, the river
            delta of Phutsirang and finally the Pin Bhabha Pass. Every Day is a
